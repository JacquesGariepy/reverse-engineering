## Motivation

In today's fast-paced software development world, code understanding and maintenance are more critical than ever. Legacy systems, large codebases, security concerns, and constant technological evolution create significant challenges for developers. This project was born to address key pain points:

1. **Reducing Time and Complexity**: Understanding a new or legacy codebase can take weeks. **reverse-engineering** aims to reduce this time by up to 60%, making onboarding and code review more efficient.
2. **AI-Powered Insights for Quality and Security**: Most code editors and IDEs only offer syntactic checks. Our tool integrates LLMs to provide semantic analysis, detecting logical errors and security vulnerabilities that typical static analysis tools may miss.
3. **Facilitating Learning**: Understanding and replicating advanced algorithms and design patterns can be challenging for students and junior developers. **reverse-engineering** acts as a learning assistant, explaining each component clearly and succinctly.

     gpt-4o-2024-08-06:
       name: "gpt-4o-2024-08-06"
       provider: "openai"
       max_tokens: 128000
       temperature: 0.7
     claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620:
       name: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620"

       temperature: 0.7

   rate_limit:
     limit: 150000
     time_frame: 300
   ```

## Quick Start

After installation and configuration, you can start using **reverse-engineering** right away:

```bash
# Initialize the tool
python .\reverseEngineer\cli.py init

# Analyze a Python file
analyze --file "C:\Temp\test\mycode.py" --language python --test-file "test_mycode.py"

# Refactoring
refactor --file "C:\Temp\test\mycode.py" --language python --test-file "test_mycode.py"

# Generate documentation for a JavaScript file
python cli.py generate-documentation --file path/to/your/code.js --language javascript

# Perform a security audit on a C++ file
python cli.py security-audit --file path/to/your/code.cpp --language cpp
```

## Usage Examples

### Code Analysis

```bash
python cli.py analyze --file complex_algorithm.py --language python
```

**Example Output**:
```
Analysis of complex_algorithm.py:
1. The file implements a graph traversal algorithm using depth-first search.
2. Key functions:
   - create_graph(): Initializes the graph structure
   - dfs(graph, start, visited=None): Performs the depth-first search
3. Time complexity: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
4. Space complexity: O(V) for the visited set and recursion stack.
5. Potential optimization: Consider using an iterative approach to reduce stack overflow risk for large graphs.
```

### Security Audit

```bash
python cli.py security-audit --file login_system.php --language php
```

**Example Output**:
```
Security Audit Results for login_system.php:
1. [HIGH] SQL Injection vulnerability detected on line 23. Use prepared statements instead of string concatenation.
2. [MEDIUM] Weak password hashing algorithm (MD5) used. Recommend switching to bcrypt or Argon2.
3. [LOW] Session ID is not regenerated after login, potentially allowing session fixation attacks.
4. [INFO] Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks.
```

## Architecture Overview

**reverse-engineering** relies on several core components:

- **Command Line Interface**: Powered by `Typer`, the CLI acts as the gateway to interacting with the tool's core capabilities.
- **ReverseEngineer Core**: The main logic, including language model interaction, is handled by the `ReverseEngineer` class.
- **Utilities Module**: Handles auxiliary functions, such as file reading, processing commands, and saving outputs.
- **Language Models**: Supports OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, and other LLMs, depending on user preferences and configurations.
- **Interactive Shell**: After executing a command, users can continue in an interactive mode, allowing iterative analysis without restarting the tool.

## How It Works

**reverse-engineering** uses the `aider` library to interact with different language models. It loads configurations from YAML files and environment variables, initializes the models, and uses `typer` to expose the core functionality via CLI. This combination ensures that:

1. Developers can easily switch between different models.
2. The output can be customized and tailored to user requirements.
3. It can scale from individual analysis to integrating it into CI/CD workflows.

## Dependencies

- [typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/): For creating the command-line interface.
- [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/): For data validation and settings management.
- [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv): For loading environment variables.
- [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org/): For parsing YAML configuration files.
- [requests](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/): For making HTTP requests.
- [aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider): For interacting with language models.

## Best Practices

- **Keep Configuration Files Up to Date**: Maintain `.env` and `config.yaml` for the latest API keys and model settings.
- **Integrate Security Audits**: Perform regular security audits on new commits to maintain codebase integrity.
- **Refactor Regularly**: Use the smart refactoring feature periodically to improve code quality and reduce technical debt.
